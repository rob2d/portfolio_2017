# ROADMAP #
## [ Roadmap All the Things â„¢ ] ##

Migrating to Github Issues now that that has improved quite a bit since this was started a few years ago, but for things not yet listed that are lower priority or random notes, this is a good backup resource.

## About
- complete new layout.
- write new SkillOrbs component using hooks to replace older view since page is not very sexy without it.
- scroller for text as current format is TMI for certain types of users.

## Projects
- Use vertical space a bit better in the Details layout on wide screens.
- get rid of YouTube lib currently used for something lighter/hooks-friendly for `MediaViewer`.
- use grid layout for ultrawide monitors like mine at home which cannot in any way use pixel-grid-snapping/zoom to look less awkward.

## CV
- use better library for rendering now that resume creation is 100% code-generated.

## Misc
- auto-generate sitemap.xml using react-router library.
- generate meta data for content on serverside (possibly integrated with point right above).

## Nice-to-haves

- allow filtering of techs in Projects view.
- Add a React hook for routing + classNames to create nice section.
scroll left/right transitions.
- Code preview button for each section.

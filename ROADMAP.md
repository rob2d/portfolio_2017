# ROADMAP #
## [ Roadmap All the Things â„¢ ] ##
------------------------------

## MediaReel

- cache instances of YouTube player while parent still mounted so that there's no need to reload iframe

## Technologies

- allow filtering of techs in Projects view (not high priority)

## Project Details

- Use vertical space a bit better in the layout on wide screens.

- When a project card fades into a title, it should retain a banner that is faded from white (should make `ProjectDescription` view a lot less depressing for people who aren't me ðŸ™ƒ)

## Refactors

- inline SVGs from mdi library -- decreased page size + responsiveness

                A little about me and why this page exists: I have always been a curious person who grew up dabbling
                a lot of introverted hobbies which included: creating websites, videogames, apps, and designing UIs 
                (all of which are things I still love today and all of which there isn't enough time in the day for). 
                This site is a small collection of mostly self-driven projects that I wish I had more time to devote 
                to (the ones which made it somewhere beyond the drawing board). 
                You probably won't find the most beautiful code on this portfolio itself since I spend most of my 
                energy at work -- or, at fun, or on hobbies, or just being a human and doing those things that they do, 
                but I do try to update here and there.
            </p>

                My background: I joined the Navy as an Electronic Technician out of highschool to get some practical experience, 
                grow as a person, make the best of my situation, and to take the more scenic route and so that I could
                also devote a lot of undivided attention to my studies and projects. Since completing graduate school in Computer 
                Science, I have gotten to work in a variety of industries at various capacities including power/skyscraper 
                infrastructure mapping and management, intellectual property, virtual reality tours, finance, as well as 
                consistently on my own side projects which include development tools and small applications.
